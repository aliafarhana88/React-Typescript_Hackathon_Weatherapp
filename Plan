  thigs to add:

- response to fetch error by stop rendering the weather card.
- work on the try and catch error handling (repair useFetch custom hook if needed)
- in weatherCard: work on the datalist / drop down list (or change to button)
- fetch the background image. fix the problem with the double fetch request
- in weatherCard : convert degreeF into degreeC for temperature & feels like
- add dark mode toggle : use useContext hook
- add a default background when the app mounts, and then change the background to city background
  -consider use smaller background for city, and then a larger plain background at the back.
  -consider wrapping background div in the main App.js (instead of making it a component)
